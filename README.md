# Introduction
In this project,we used the grover's algorithm to solve a boolean satisfiability problem.
Grover algorithm is a quantum algorithm used to search for an element in an unsorted array quadratically faster than the classical linear search for large dataset.We have searched the best possible combinations of boolean variables (taking values:'True' or 'False') in all the combination possible.
# Running the code
You can install jupyter notebook and run the code locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from command line.
Alternatively,you can also run the file in google colab.
